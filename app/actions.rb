#Why do we use the user.id stored in the session hash?
# Main reason is what would be the most basic information that we could use 
# that would allow us to identify a specific user record? Also technically 
# (not a huge deal) the id value is a smaller size of information that we have 
# to send through HTTP. And yeah, using the id value doesnâ€™t disclose any 
# sensitive information about the user.

# from https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#session-id-content-or-value
# "The session ID must simply be an identifier on the client side, and its value must never include sensitive information"
